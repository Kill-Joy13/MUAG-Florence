    <h2>A Study of <i>Florence</i> by Mountains: The Impact Of Sound And Visuals In Immersive Storytelling.</h2>
<br>I will explore the emotional themes and visual motifs of the game Florence by Mountains.</br>

<br>The game Florence uses many design techniques to help envelope the player into the game. Moreover, with these techniques, 
      the game becomes an experience rather than an activity.</br>

        <br>The first of which I will be discussing is the use of color. In the game, Florence's color is the most significant indicator of mood and tone. <br>
      The game makers used a variety of palettes from start to finish that helped the viewer explore and understand the storyline <br>
      and the protagonist's' inner feelings. The protagonist, Florence, says mental health is directly reflected within the color scheme of the world around her. <br>
      This, I believe, is an excellent example of Masumi’s effect. As players and humans, color directly affects our psychology.<br>
      With these sudden and dramatic color shifts, we are instantly reacting, though we do not quite know what until after the chapter has played out. </br>

The second I will discuss is sound and, in this instance, music. In the game, Florence's music is a huge aspect of creating an environment and the plot. </br>
      As one of the main characters is a musician, we can follow not only the protagonist but also Krish through life and through their innermost feelings  </br>
      that are expressed through the color palette and the music choice. </br>
 <center>
    <body> 
<br>The music in this game was created chapter by chapter like a soundtrack for each leg of the story; the similar yet different tones and rhythms allow for a <br>
      soundscape that truly engulfs you in the story. Moreover, It helps create more authentic and gradual changes in affect and then emotion, much like in horror movies.<br>
      When you hear those sinister tonal changes start to play, your body instantly knows something is to come far before your mind knows what exactly to be afraid of.<br>
      Moreover, that is precisely what is happening here but on a subtler scale.</br>
    
 <center>
    <body> 
<br>These narrative tools along with others allow for quite a simple puzzle game to turn into an emotional and almost therapeutic experience. <br>
      The storyline and theme of this game is of one many of us can relate to being stuck in a job and in a place in life feeling very uninspired <br>
      with the enormous of life really weighing us down to meeting people and having them in our lives for a short time but those experiences negative <br>
      and positive help move us forward if we allow them to. In this way and with this somewhat repetitive Game that mirrors life in a way of waking up brushing <br>
      your teeth working waking up brushing your teeth working and so on we are able to live out our choices in life in a short amount of time.</br>
