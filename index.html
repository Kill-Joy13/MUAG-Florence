    <h2>A Study of <i>Florence</i> by Mountains: The Impact Of Sound And Visuals In Immersive Storytelling.</h2>
<br>I will explore the emotional themes and visual motifs of the game Florence by Mountains.</br>

<br>The game Florence uses many design techniques to help envelope the player into the game. Moreover, with these techniques, 
      the game becomes an experience rather than an activity.</br>

        <h1><br>The first of which I will be discussing is the use of color. In the game, Florence's color is the most significant indicator of mood and tone. <br>
      The game makers used a variety of palettes from start to finish that helped the viewer explore and understand the storyline <br>
      and the protagonist's' inner feelings. The protagonist, Florence, says mental health is directly reflected within the color scheme of the world around her. <br>
      This, I believe, is an excellent example of Masumi’s effect. As players and humans, color directly affects our psychology.<br>
      With these sudden and dramatic color shifts, we are instantly reacting, though we do not quite know what until after the chapter has played out. </br>

The second I will discuss is sound and, in this instance, music. In the game, Florence's music is a huge aspect of creating an environment and the plot. </br>
      As one of the main characters is a musician, we can follow not only the protagonist but also Krish through life and through their innermost feelings  </br>
      that are expressed through the color palette and the music choice. </br>
